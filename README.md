## Introduction

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which points to the next element in the sequence. It is a dynamic data structure, meaning it can grow or shrink in size during program execution. This repository provides a Java implementation of a singly linked list, where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next element in the list.

## Features

- Creation of singly linked lists.
- Insertion of elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
- Deletion of elements from the list.
- Searching for elements in the list.
- Traversing and printing the list.

## Getting Started

To get started with this linked list implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-linked-list.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code with Java extensions).

3. Build and run the project to see examples of how the linked list works.
